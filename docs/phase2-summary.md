# Phase 2: Core Workflow Extensions - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Phase 2 significantly expands the git-flow-mcp server capabilities by adding four powerful new tools that provide
comprehensive workflow automation, status monitoring, issue tracking integration, and advanced conflict resolution.

## New Tools Implemented

### 1. `track-issues.ts` - Issue Tracking Integration

**Purpose:** Connect git workflows with project management systems (JIRA, GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues)

**Key Features:**

- **Platform Detection:** Automatically detects JIRA, GitHub, or GitLab based on CLI availability and remote URLs
- **Auto-Detection:** Intelligently extracts issue IDs from branch names (JIRA-123, #456, issue-789)
- **Multi-Platform Support:** Works with JIRA CLI, GitHub CLI (`gh`), and GitLab CLI (`glab`)
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Create, fetch, comment, transition, and link issues

**Actions:**

- `fetch` - Retrieve and display issue details
- `transition` - Move issues through workflow states (In Progress, Done, etc.)
- `comment` - Add comments to issues
- `link` - Connect git branches to issues via git notes
- `create` - Create new issues with full metadata

**Example Usage:**

```json
{
  "action": "fetch",
  "issueKey": "PROJ-123",
  "autoDetect": true
}
```

### 2. `monitor-status.ts` - Comprehensive Status Monitoring

**Purpose:** Monitor PR/MR status, CI/CD pipelines, and feedback across different platforms

**Key Features:**

- **Multi-Target Monitoring:** PR status, CI runs, feedback analysis, branch status, and comprehensive overview
- **Platform Agnostic:** Works with GitHub and GitLab
- **Intelligent Feedback Analysis:** Identifies unresolved comments and change requests
- **CI/CD Integration:** Monitors workflow runs and pipeline status
- **Rich Status Display:** Color-coded indicators and detailed breakdowns

**Targets:**

- `pr` - Pull Request/Merge Request status with reviews and mergeability
- `ci` - CI/CD pipeline status and recent run history
- `feedback` - Unresolved comments and review feedback
- `branch` - Local/remote branch status and sync information
- `all` - Comprehensive overview of all status types

**Example Usage:**

```json
{
  "target": "all",
  "includeDetails": true,
  "filterUnresolved": true
}
```

### 3. `orchestrate-workflow.ts` - High-Level Workflow Automation

**Purpose:** Combine multiple git operations into common development workflow patterns

**Key Features:**

- **End-to-End Workflows:** Complete automation from branch creation to PR merge
- **Dry-Run Support:** Preview all operations before execution
- **Smart Defaults:** Intelligent branch naming and PR title generation
- **Test Integration:** Automatic test execution during feature completion
- **Multi-Platform PR Creation:** GitHub and GitLab support with reviewers and labels

**Workflows:**

- `start-work` - Create feature branch, sync with base, set up tracking
- `complete-feature` - Sync, test, push, create PR, assign reviewers
- `address-feedback` - Stage changes, commit, push, comment on PR
- `hotfix` - Emergency branch creation and fast-track PR process
- `release-prep` - Release branch creation with version management
- `cleanup` - Clean merged branches and optimize repository

**Example Usage:**

```json
{
  "workflow": "complete-feature",
  "ticket": "PROJ-123",
  "assignReviewers": ["@reviewer1", "@reviewer2"],
  "labels": ["feature", "ready-for-review"]
}
```

### 4. `resolve-conflicts.ts` - Advanced Conflict Resolution

**Purpose:** Intelligent merge conflict resolution with multiple resolution strategies

**Key Features:**

- **Smart Resolution Patterns:** Automatically resolves common conflict types
- **Conflict Analysis:** Detailed analysis of conflict blocks and resolution suggestions
- **Multiple Strategies:** "ours", "theirs", "smart", and manual assistance modes
- **Backup Protection:** Automatic stashing before resolution attempts
- **Operation Continuation:** Automatically continues merge/rebase operations after resolution

**Advanced Patterns:**

- Empty side detection (choose non-empty version)
- Subset detection (choose superset version)
- Import/require merging (combine and deduplicate)
- Version conflict handling (prefer newer versions)
- Simple addition combining (merge both additions)

**Actions:**

- `status` - Show current conflict state and affected files
- `analyze` - Detailed conflict analysis with resolution suggestions
- `auto-resolve` - Apply intelligent resolution strategies
- `manual-assist` - Provide guided manual resolution assistance
- `abort` - Safely abort merge/rebase operations

**Example Usage:**

```json
{
  "action": "auto-resolve",
  "strategy": "smart",
  "backupChanges": true,
  "continueOperation": true
}
```

## Integration Benefits

### 1. Seamless Tool Interactions

The Phase 2 tools are designed to work together:

- `orchestrate-workflow` can trigger `track-issues` for status updates
- `monitor-status` provides feedback that `orchestrate-workflow` can address
- `resolve-conflicts` is automatically triggered during sync operations
- All tools share common platform detection and CLI validation

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

- Comprehensive validation with clear error messages
- Graceful degradation when CLI tools are unavailable
- Safe operation modes (dry-run, backup, preview)
- Detailed logging of all operations performed

### 3. Developer Experience

- **Intelligent Defaults:** Minimal configuration required for common scenarios
- **Rich Feedback:** Emoji indicators, color coding, and detailed progress tracking
- **Safety First:** Backup creation, dry-run modes, and operation previews
- **Platform Flexibility:** Works across GitHub, GitLab, and JIRA ecosystems

## Phase 2 Architecture

### Tool Structure

Each tool follows the standardized structure:

```typescript
export const schema = { /* Zod parameter validation */ };
export const metadata: ToolMetadata = { /* Tool information */ };
export default async function toolName(params) { /* Implementation */ }
```

### Common Patterns

- **Command Execution:** Safe execution with error handling and output capture
- **Platform Detection:** Automatic detection of git hosting platforms
- **CLI Validation:** Verification of required tools (gh, glab, jira)
- **Status Tracking:** Detailed step logging and warning collection
- **Response Formatting:** Consistent markdown formatting with emoji indicators

### Error Recovery

- **Stash Management:** Automatic stashing and restoration of working directory
- **Operation Abort:** Safe termination of long-running operations
- **Conflict Preservation:** Maintains conflict state for manual resolution when needed
- **Rollback Capability:** Ability to undo operations where appropriate

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Complete Feature Development

```json
// Start work on a ticket
{
  "workflow": "start-work",
  "ticket": "PROJ-123"
}

// Complete and submit for review
{
  "workflow": "complete-feature",
  "ticket": "PROJ-123",
  "assignReviewers": ["@senior-dev"]
}

// Monitor for feedback
{
  "target": "feedback",
  "filterUnresolved": true
}

// Address feedback and continue
{
  "workflow": "address-feedback",
  "message": "Fixed all review comments"
}
```

### 2. Conflict Resolution

```json
// Analyze conflicts during merge
{
  "action": "analyze"
}

// Attempt smart resolution
{
  "action": "auto-resolve",
  "strategy": "smart",
  "previewOnly": true
}

// Apply resolution
{
  "action": "auto-resolve",
  "strategy": "smart"
}
```

### 3. Status Monitoring

```json
// Check everything
{
  "target": "all",
  "includeDetails": false
}

// Focus on specific issues
{
  "target": "ci",
  "branch": "feature/new-ui"
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies

- **Core:** TypeScript, Zod for validation, Node.js child_process for command execution
- **File System:** fs module for conflict file analysis and resolution
- **Platform CLIs:** gh (GitHub), glab (GitLab), jira (Atlassian)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Operations:** Where safe, operations are performed concurrently
- **Caching:** Platform detection and CLI availability checks are cached
- **Selective Loading:** Large operations only load necessary data
- **Error Short-Circuiting:** Fast failure for invalid states

### Security Considerations

- **Command Injection Prevention:** All user inputs are properly sanitized
- **File System Safety:** Conflict resolution operates only on git-tracked files
- **Backup Creation:** Automatic backup before destructive operations
- **CLI Validation:** Verification of CLI tool availability and authentication

## Future Enhancements (Phase 3+)

- **Web Hooks Integration:** Real-time status updates from CI/CD systems
- **Advanced Analytics:** Workflow metrics and performance insights
